This Python template is designed to calculate the RPM for the wheels of a two-wheel differential drive robot, based on the linear and angular velocities specified by your control code. For demonstration purposes, static values of 0.5 m/s for linear_x and 0 rad/s for angular_z have been used; however, these should be replaced with the dynamic values obtained from your controller.
Also the values marked as "x" should be replaced by actual values
